# Alura_Books
Responsive mobile first project developed from a video tutorial

There are some issues pending. The website has a header, a banner, a carroussel with a card in the bottom, another carroussel with another card in the bottom and a footer.
The pending issues for this version are:

1. Pictures of books in the carrouseel should be closer to each other, but they have a wide gap.
2. The card in the bottom is supposed to move next to the right side of the carroussel when the width of the gadget is expanded to 1728 px.

   I am still trying to figure out how to solve these issues.
